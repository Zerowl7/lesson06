## About the project
In this project, I made a fully functioning restaurant website

- **Made an admin panel that is denied access to ordinary users**
-**Made migrations for 4 tables:**
1. Tables
2. Menu
3. Booking
4. Categories
- **I also set up controllers for each model and made blades.**
- **All tables are added to the admin panel with the GRUD method**
- **Created a relationship Menu and Categories of many-to-many table**
- **Set up validation, flash alerts, as well as rules for booking by time and date via Rules**
